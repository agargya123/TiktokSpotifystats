# TiktokSpotifystats
Descriptive and statistical analysis project to analyse the relationship between a song's virality on a content/social media platform like TikTok and its popularity on a music streaming application Spotify.
Since TikTok usage shot hugely during COVID, we selected 2022 as the scope for this analysis, since it allows the market to stabilize. 
Data compares popularity of a song on TikTok (measured through 'popularity' variable, in TikTok dataset) and measures of performance on Spotify (represented by 'weeks on chart' and 'peak rank')
